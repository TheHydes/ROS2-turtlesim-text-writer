# ROS2-turtlesim-text-writer
ROS2 (Humble Hawksbill), turtlesim, it draws text, thats it, ggs
Uses the English ABC
usage:

ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
ros2 run ros2_course turtlesim_controller


Update ideas: 
-launching turtlesim_controller should launch the node, so it's 1 less line to type manually.
-wall detection, if the letter would touch the wall, go to the next line
